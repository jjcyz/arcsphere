# Arc'Sphere

A community platform for Arc'teryx partners to build communities, seek support, answer questions, and plan meetups. Powered by Groq's LLM technology.

## Overview

Arc'Sphere is a modern web application that helps Arc'teryx partners connect and collaborate. The platform features an AI-powered chatbot (Arc'BOT) built with Groq's LLM technology to provide intelligent assistance to users.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- A Groq API key (for the AI chatbot functionality)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:jjczy/arcsphere.git
cd arcsphere
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:
```
PORT=5001
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434
VITE_GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

Replace `your_groq_api_key_here` with your actual Groq API key.

## Running the Application

You need to run both the server and the frontend. Open two terminal windows:

1. Start the server:
```bash
npm run server
# or
node server/index.js
```

2. In a new terminal, start the frontend:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application should now be running at:
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173 (or the port shown in your terminal)
- Backend: http://localhost:5001
